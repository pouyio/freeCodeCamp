# Portfolio ([Online version ðŸŒŽ](https://pouyio.github.io/freeCodeCamp/frontEnd/01portfolio/))
My solution to [this project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) for **FreeCodeCamp**. Personal portfolio where I can show my work and contact links.

## Technical details

I used pure HTML/CSS and Javascript. I made use of [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io) for the icons. Normalize.css included too. [Gumshoe](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gumshoe/) library for the navbar scroll spy.

Also in [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/pouyio/full/EjBRmB/)
