# Quote Machine ([Online version ðŸŒŽ](https://pouyio.github.io/freeCodeCamp/frontEnd/02quoteMachine/))

My solution to the [Zipline: Build a Random Quote Machine](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-random-quote-machine) exercise from **FreeCodeCamp**. Simple random cat facts made in HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

Also in [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/pouyio/pen/JYowMb).

## Technical details

Apart from HTML,CSS and Javascript, I made use of fontawesome and jQuery. Normalize.css included too. My first project trying to apply Module pattern to organize all code. Implemented my own *cache image system* to prevent blank backgrounds or loading waitings. First background image is always the same due to a better perfomance.

APIs used:
- Background images loaded from [thecatapi.com](http://exhibitionnest.com/cat), returning a random cat image from tumblr.
- Cat facts API from [here](http://catfacts-api.appspot.com).
- Avoiding CORS problems using [json2jsonp.com](https://json2jsonp.com).
